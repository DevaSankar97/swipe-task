As a Software Development Engineer at JioMart, I was involved in building and maintaining high-performance, customer-facing web applications for one of India's largest eCommerce platforms. I worked primarily with React.js to develop dynamic, reusable UI components and contributed to backend services using Node.js. My focus was on delivering seamless user experiences, improving site performance, and collaborating with design and product teams to roll out new features efficiently.
