Dear JioAirFiber Support Team,

I am writing to report that my JioAirFiber internet connection has been down for the past 6 days. I raised a Service Request (SR00002CBQ6Y), but unfortunately, no technician has been assigned to resolve the issue so far.

Details:

Service Request Number: SR00002CBQ6Y

Registered Mobile Number: 9990009999

Name: Raam

The delay is causing major inconvenience, and I kindly request that this issue be treated as a priority. Please arrange for a technician visit and provide an update on the resolution timeline at the earliest.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
Raam
