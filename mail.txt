Dear Jio Customer Care,

I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding my JioAirFiber service linked to my registered mobile number 9988998899. The service has not been working properly, and despite my repeated efforts, the issue remains unresolved.

Previously, I raised a service request (SR000002COBAF) which was unexpectedly closed on 01-05-2025 without my consent or the problem being addressed. This has caused unnecessary delays and inconvenience.

I have since raised a new service request (SR00002C8Q6Y), but as of now, no technician has been assigned. The lack of follow-up and poor service experience is disappointing, especially considering the importance of reliable internet connectivity.

I request that this issue be treated as urgent, and a technician be assigned at the earliest to restore the service. I would also appreciate clarification on why the earlier request was closed without my approval or any resolution.

Account Details:
Name: Deva Sankar
Mobile: 9988998899
Previous SR: SR000002COBAF
New SR: SR00002C8Q6Y

Thank you for your attention and prompt action.

Sincerely,
Deva Sankar
